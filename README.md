# K_Relay
A modular Realm of the Mad God man-in-the-middle Proxy

Please do not share this code. You're not allowed to re-release this.

Things left to do:
- [x] Core Reconnect plugin
- [x] Finish the plugins tab
- [ ] Define all packets
- [x] Fetch server list from char/list
- [x] Overload packet member indexers 
- [ ] Redo Info tab
- [ ] Fix PropertyGrid compatability with Settings StringCollection
- [ ] Add advanced settings (for things like RC4 keys)
- [ ] Create user Packet constructor
- [ ] Add welcome to K Relay message
- [ ] More that I can't think of at the moment
